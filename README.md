# For seth

1. Open VSCode and Click Source Control (button below search) on the left sidebar.
2. If it asks to download "Git SCM", click the button and install using default settings (press next a bunch of times until it closes).
3. Restart VSCode after Git SCM has installed, then go back to Source Control (button below search!!!!!!!!).
4. If you installed Git SCM correctly, it should say "Clone Repository". If not, msg me on snap: `tygerxqt`
